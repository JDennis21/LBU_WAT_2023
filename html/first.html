    <h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
    <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
    <p>
        A paragraph with<i> some words that are emphasised</i> and<b> some important words.</b> Followed by some
        <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text formatting that appeals to you.
    <p>
    <pre><small>
        This is some text
        that is laid out exactly as
        Laidout at code level without any additional
        markup
    </small></pre>
    <h2>Special Characters</h2>
    <code>
        The browser thinks < is a programming character. Also >. The browser also ignores any line breaks<br>
        in your code and any &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;white space. To include these you need to use special
        character entities aka html character entities. There are other entities available such as &pound; and &amp;
    </code>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to separate sites such as
        <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">LeedsBeckett</a>. Links to other pages of the
        <a href="secondPage.html">same site</a>. Links to another point in
        <a href="#anchor">same page</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
        This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder
        <img src="../images/logo.jpg" height="100" width="100" alt="Leeds Beckett logo">
    </p>
    <!--TODO make text wrap image correctly-->
    <p>I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers</p>
    <p id="anchor">
        Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using W3C Markup Validation Service
        without the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and chose inspect or view source
        you can check your code and see the HTML comment you have added inside the body tag
